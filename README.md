# Global_vegetation_water_sensitivity
This repository contains two parts for a paper to be published as: Li, W., Migliavacca, M., Forkel, M., Denissen, J.M.C., Reichstein, M., Yang, H., Duveiller, G., Weber, U. and Orth, R. (2022). Widespread increasing vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture (Under review).

i) Demo codes and data required to calculate overall and 3-year-block LAI sensitivities to soil moisture;

ii) Codes required to reproduce main figures in the paper. The data for the figures are available from 'zenodo link' as the data size is big.

We use the demo for transparency and to demonstrate the application of sensitivity analysis using machine learning.

### The guide of demo_of_sensitivity_analysis

### The guide of figure_codes
i) All processed data are in NumPy array format for Python;

ii) Original data are shared with public links in the paper.
